# Components

## Atoms:

Basic building blocks of matter, such as a button, input or a form label. Theyâ€™re not really useful on their own.

## Molecules:

Grouping atoms together, such as combining a button, input and form label to build functionality.

## Organisms:

Combining molecules together to organisms that make up a distinct section (i.e. a login form)
